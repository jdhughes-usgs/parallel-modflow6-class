# Course Description
The purpose of this 2-day workshop is to teach participants how to use the new parallel capabilities in MODFLOW.  The course will provide an overview of the MODFLOW 6 program, the Python tools available for pre- and post-processing simulations, and the concepts for parallel computing with MODFLOW.  The course will include hands-on exercises that progress from serial simulations on laptops to parallel simulations on Denali.  

# Getting Started

Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is a straight forward way for Windows users to get started using the parallel version of MODFLOW. Instructions for setting up WSL and compiling the parallel version of MODFLOW is provided in [wsl_setup.md](./wsl_setup.md).

If you are using the MacOS or Linux operating system you can follow the instructions in [wsl_setup.md](./wsl_setup.md) starting at the [Installing_Miniconda section](./wsl_setup.md#installing-miniconda).
